# Turborepo NextJS + Tailwind + tRPC

## About

Ever wondered how to migrate your T3 application into a monorepo? Stop right here! This is the perfect starter repo to get you running with the perfect stack!

It uses [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) and contains:

## Quick Start

To get it running, follow the steps below:

### Setup dependencies

```diff
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# In packages/db/prisma update schema.prisma provider to use sqlite
# or use your own database provider
- provider = "postgresql"
+ provider = "sqlite"

# Configure environment variables.
# There is an `.env.example` in the root directory you can use for reference
cp .env.example .env

# Push the Prisma schema to your database
pnpm db:push
```

## Deployment

### Next.js

#### Prerequisites

_We do not recommend deploying a SQLite database on serverless environments since the data wouldn't be persisted. I provisioned a quick Postgresql database on [Railway](https://railway.app), but you can of course use any other database provider. Make sure the prisma schema is updated to use the correct database._

**Please note that the Next.js application with tRPC must be deployed in order for the Expo app to communicate with the server in a production environment.**

#### Deploy to Vercel

Let's deploy the Next.js application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). If you have ever deployed a Turborepo app there, the steps are quite straightforward. You can also read the [official Turborepo guide](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/monorepos/turborepo) on deploying to Vercel.

1. Create a new project on Vercel, select the `apps/app` folder as the root directory and apply the following build settings:

> The install command filters out the expo package and saves a few second (and cache size) of dependency installation. The build command makes us build the application using Turbo.

2. Add your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

3. Done! Your app should successfully deploy. Assign your domain and use that instead of `localhost` for the `url` in the Expo app so that your Expo app can communicate with your backend when you are not in development.
