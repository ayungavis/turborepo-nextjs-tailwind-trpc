In order to scale the application in the easiest and most maintainable way, keep most of the code inside the containers folder, which should contain different feature-based things. Every container folder should contain domain specific code for a given feature. This will allow you to keep functionalities scoped to a feature and not mix its declarations with shared things. This is much easier to maintain than a flat folder structure with many files.
