# Auth Proxy

This is a simple proxy server that enables OAuth authentication for preview environments.

## Setup

Deploy it somewhere (Vercel is a one-click, zero-config option) and set the following environment variables:

- `AUTH_DISCORD_ID` - The Discord OAuth client ID
- `AUTH_DISCORD_SECRET` - The Discord OAuth client secret
- `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` - The URL of this proxy server
- `AUTH_SECRET` - Your secret

Make sure the `AUTH_SECRET` and `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` match the values set for the main application's deployment for preview environments, and that you're using the same OAuth credentials for the proxy and the application's preview environment. The lines below shows what values should match eachother in both deployments.
